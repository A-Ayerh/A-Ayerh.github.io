        <h2>Brainwaves and EEG Data in Spatial Mapping</h2>
        <p>
            Understanding the brainwaves captured during EEG monitoring is crucial for spatial mapping. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the specific brainwave types we will be using in this project:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Alpha Waves (8-13 Hz):</strong> Typically associated with relaxation and calm states, Alpha waves are key when analyzing spatial attention and focus.</li>
            <li><strong>Beta Waves (13-30 Hz):</strong> These waves are linked to active thinking, problem-solving, and motor control. They will be particularly important for mapping brain activity during motor tasks.</li>
            <li><strong>Theta Waves (4-8 Hz):</strong> Related to deep meditation, sleep, and learning. Theta waves can provide insight into subconscious brain processes during spatial mapping.</li>
            <li><strong>Gamma Waves (30-100 Hz):</strong> The fastest brainwaves, associated with higher cognitive functions, memory, and learning. Gamma waves will help in mapping complex motor tasks and higher-level brain activities.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Exploring Spatial Mapping Algorithms</h2>
        <p>
            The choice of spatial mapping algorithm is critical to the success of the project. Initially, we will explore simpler algorithms to get started with the EEG data, with a plan to transition to more advanced models as the project develops.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Principal Component Analysis (PCA):</strong> PCA is a simple dimensionality reduction algorithm that helps us reduce the noise in the EEG data and focus on the most important spatial patterns in the brain's electrical activity.</li>
            <li><strong>t-SNE (t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding):</strong> t-SNE is a powerful tool for visualizing high-dimensional EEG data. It will be useful in representing brain activity in a lower-dimensional space for easier visualization of spatial patterns.</li>
            <li><strong>Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs):</strong> CNNs are often used for image recognition, but they are also excellent for analyzing spatial data from EEG signals, treating the electrode positions as 2D data points for recognizing patterns.</li>
            <li><strong>Future Considerations: LSTM Networks:</strong> LSTMs will be explored in the later stages of the project. These networks are well-suited for capturing temporal dependencies, allowing us to analyze h
